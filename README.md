Overview
The Pronunciation Assessment System allows users to assess their pronunciation of words and sentences. By providing immediate, detailed feedback on mispronounced words, it assists users in refining their pronunciation accuracy. Key components of the system include:

Real-time Speech Recognition: Continuous listening and speech-to-text conversion using the Google Speech Recognition API.
Pronunciation Comparison: Checks for pronunciation accuracy using phonetic similarity and word-by-word analysis.
Text-to-Speech Feedback: The system uses pyttsx3 for delivering spoken feedback.
Features
Speech Recognition: Users can speak into their microphone and receive instant feedback.
Pronunciation Feedback: Provides a word-by-word analysis comparing spoken text to the correct text.
Real-time Processing: Continuously listens to speech, allowing users to practice pronunciation in real-time.
Customizable Sentences: Users can input their own sentences for assessment.
Interactive Feedback: Clear visual and spoken feedback using pyttsx3.
How It Works
Speech Input: The system listens to the userâ€™s speech via the microphone.
Speech Recognition: Converts the spoken words into text using the Google Speech Recognition API.
Pronunciation Assessment: Compares the recognized text with the correct text, identifying mispronunciations.
